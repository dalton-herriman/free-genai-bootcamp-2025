## Overview

This repository contains the code for the Free GenAI Bootcamp 2025. The bootcamp is put on by Andrew Brown and ExamPro.
All the code in this repository was created by me, inspired by the bootcamp and often times following architecture, patterns, and best practices from the bootcamp.

Sometimes, code was copied directly from the bootcamp or from other sources.
