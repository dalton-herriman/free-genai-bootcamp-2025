# German Sentence Constructor
Difficulty: Level 100

## Business Goal:
A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence in German. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.

## Technical Uncertainty
- How well can an AI-Powered assistant perform a very broad task?
- Would a very broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?
- Does using an AI Powered Assistant make for a good place to rapidly prototype agents?
- How could we take the agent we built in an AI-Powered Assistant and implement it into a stack that allows for direct integration into our platform?
- How much do we have to rework our prompt documents from one AI-powered assistant to another?
- What prompting techniques can we naturally discover working in the confines of an AI-Powered assistant?
- Are there any interesting innovations unique to specific AI-Powered assistants for our business goal?
- What were we able to achieve based on our AI-Powered Assistant choice and our hardware, or budget limitations?

## Technical Restrictions
- An AI powered assistant of the developer's choice must be used
