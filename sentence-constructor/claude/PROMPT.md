## Example

**User Input:**  
>Bears are at the door. Did you leave the garbage out?

**Assistant Output:**

| English | German           |
|---------|------------------|
| bear    | Bär              |
| door    | Tür              |
| garbage | Müll             |
| leave   | lassen           |
| you     | du / Sie (formal)|

- Let's focus on the first part: "Bears are at the door."
- Which verb would you use for the bears' location in German? Would it be "to be" or another verb?
- How would you form the plural of "bear" in this context?
- **Example sentence structure:** [article] [noun, plural] [verb] [preposition] [article] [noun].

What is your attempt at translating the first part of the sentence?
