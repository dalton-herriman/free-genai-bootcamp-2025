## Functional Requirements
- **Data Privacy & Security:** User data must remain on-premises to address privacy concerns. All AI processing, including model inference and data storage, should be handled within the company’s infrastructure, minimizing exposure to external networks.
- **Cost Management:** The company anticipates that managed GenAI services will become increasingly expensive. By investing in their own hardware, they seek to avoid unpredictable operational costs and maintain control over their AI expenditure.
- **Hardware Investment:** The company plans to purchase a high-performance AI PC or workstation, with a budget of $10,000–$15,000. This system should be capable of running modern large language models (LLMs) and supporting GPU-accelerated workloads.
- **User Base:** The system must support approximately 300 active students, all located within the city of Nagasaki. The infrastructure should be sized to handle concurrent usage and provide low-latency responses.
- **System Architecture:** 
    - The solution will include a local database for storing user data and activity logs.
    - The AI PC will host the LLM and serve as the primary inference engine.
    - Input and output guardrails will be implemented to ensure safe and appropriate interactions with the AI model.
    - The system will be designed to operate primarily within a local network, with optional, controlled access to the internet for updates or external data retrieval.
- **User Interaction:** Students will interact with the system through a user interface that communicates with the local AI model. All requests and responses will be processed internally, with guardrails in place to filter inappropriate content and ensure compliance with privacy policies.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** The infrastructure should be modular, allowing for future upgrades (e.g., additional GPUs, storage, or network enhancements) as the user base or AI workload grows.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The system must provide low-latency responses to user queries, with an average response time of less than 2 seconds under normal load (300 concurrent users).
- **Reliability & Availability:** The infrastructure should achieve at least 99% uptime during operational hours, with mechanisms for automated recovery from hardware or software failures.
- **Security:** All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols. Access controls and authentication mechanisms must be enforced for both users and administrators.
- **Maintainability:** The system should be modular and well-documented, allowing for straightforward updates, troubleshooting, and component replacement or upgrades.
- **Scalability:** The architecture must support future expansion, such as adding more GPUs, storage, or network capacity, with minimal disruption to ongoing operations.
- **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and accessible for students and staff, requiring minimal training to use effectively.
- **Compliance:** The solution must comply with all relevant data privacy, security, and educational regulations applicable in Nagasaki, Japan.
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery:** Regular automated backups of user data and system configurations must be performed, with clear procedures for restoration in case of data loss or system failure.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** The system should include comprehensive monitoring and logging of system health, usage, and security events, with alerts for abnormal conditions.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Hardware and software should be selected and configured to optimize energy consumption, considering both operational costs and environmental impact.

## Assumptions
- **Technical Expertise:** The company has or will acquire the necessary technical expertise to set up, maintain, and secure on-premises AI infrastructure, including hardware, networking, and software components.
- **Physical Security:** The AI PC/workstation and related infrastructure will be housed in a secure location to prevent unauthorized physical access.
- **Network Environment:** All users (students) will access the system from within a secure, local network environment, minimizing exposure to external threats.
- **Data Volume:** The volume of user data and activity logs generated by 300 students is within the storage and processing capabilities of the planned hardware.
- **Model Compatibility:** The selected LLM(s) can be run efficiently on the chosen hardware, with available open-source or locally deployable models meeting the educational requirements.
- **Guardrail Effectiveness:** Input and output guardrails can be implemented effectively to filter inappropriate content and ensure compliance with privacy and safety policies.
- **Internet Access:** Occasional, controlled internet access is permissible for system updates, model improvements, or external data retrieval, but not for routine AI inference or data processing.
- **User Devices:** Students have access to compatible devices (e.g., laptops, tablets) capable of connecting to the local network and interacting with the user interface.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** The proposed solution aligns with all relevant data privacy regulations and educational policies applicable in Nagasaki, Japan.
- **Scalability:** The initial hardware investment is sufficient for current needs, with the understanding that future growth may require additional resources or upgrades.

## Data Strategy
- **Licensed Content Only:** All educational materials, including textbooks, articles, and practice questions, must be properly licensed or purchased by the company before being added to the system. No copyrighted materials will be used without explicit permission or appropriate licensing.
- **Centralized Content Repository:** The company will maintain a secure, centralized database of all learning materials. Only authorized staff may upload or update content, ensuring that only approved, legally acquired resources are available to students.
- **Content Acquisition Process:** A formal process will be established for identifying, purchasing, and documenting the licensing status of all materials. Records of licenses and purchase agreements will be maintained for audit and compliance purposes.
- **Content Usage Controls:** Access to materials will be restricted to enrolled students and staff, in accordance with licensing agreements. Materials will not be distributed or made accessible outside the organization or for purposes beyond those permitted by the license.
- **Regular Compliance Reviews:** Periodic audits will be conducted to ensure that all content in the database remains compliant with copyright and licensing requirements. Any unlicensed or questionable materials will be removed immediately.
- **Data Privacy:** Student-generated data (e.g., answers, activity logs) will be stored separately from licensed content and will not be shared externally. All data handling will comply with privacy regulations and internal policies.
